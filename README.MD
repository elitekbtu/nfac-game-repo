## About the Game

**Maze Escape: The Satpayev Incident** is a survival horror game where you navigate through the partially destroyed building of Satpayev University after a devastating earthquake.

### Story
During a quiet night, a phone call interrupts the silence. An earthquake has partially destroyed the building of Satpayev University, leaving only three floors of corridors and labyrinth-like staircases.

From the third floor, where chaos began, to the exit on the first floor, you face hunger and thirst while trying to escape.
